# Zurmo Docker (unofficial)

The structure of this project and many of its scripts were inspired by

## Requirements

* Docker engine
* Docker Compose

## Usage

To have a new system running, a simple `make` should be enough and 
the system will be running on port 80.

Check `Makefile` and `docker-compose.yml` for more details.
